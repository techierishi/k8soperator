# k8soperator
A sample K8S Operator to demonstrate crud app deployment 

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).


# User Path

> Testing has been done on local kind cluster

## Deploy operator

```sh
# clone operator repo
git clone https://github.com/techierishi/k8soperator.git
cd k8soperator

# deploy to local cluster
helm install -f chart/values.yaml crud-helm ./chart/

# now create Crud kind
./bin/kustomize build config/samples | kubectl apply -f -
```

## Port forward

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/mongocrud 8060:8060
```

## Get all resources:

```sh
kubectl get sc; kubectl get pv; kubectl get pvc; kubectl get pod; kubectl get service 
```

## Delete all created resources:

```sh
./bin/kustomize build config/samples | kubectl delete -f -; kubectl delete sc crud-storage-class; kubectl delete pv crud-pv
```

## Code explanation

`internal/controller/crud_controller.go` is the entrypoint of all reconcilers
`internal/controller/storage_class.go` is to create storage class with `AllowVolumeExpansion` capability
`internal/controller/pc.go` is to create persistent volume
`internal/controller/pvc.go` is to create persistent volume claim for database
`internal/controller/service.go` is to create node port service
`internal/controller/deployment.go` is to create deployment
`config/samples/schedule_v1_crud.yaml` has sample Crud kind yaml

# Developer Path

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=ghcr.io/techierishi/k8soperator:latest
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=ghcr.io/techierishi/k8soperator:latest
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)


## Bundle commands

```sh
make bundle IMG=ghcr.io/techierishi/k8soperator:latest
make bundle-build BUNDLE_IMG=ghcr.io/techierishi/k8soperator-bundle:latest
make docker-push IMG=ghcr.io/techierishi/k8soperator-bundle:latest

```

## Generate helm charts

```sh
make helm
```

## Caveats

- Some cluster role has too much of permission make sure operator has enough role. This should be avoided in prod 
- Best coding practices may be missing at some places keeping the mind that this is a test app
